    <div id='contentWrap'>
      <h2>Clearing floats in the age of old</h2>
      <p>When a float is contained within a container box that has a visible border or background,
        that float does not automatically force the container's bottom edge down as the float is made taller.
        Instead the float is ignored by the container and will hang down out of the container bottom like a
        flag. Those familiar only with Internet Explorer may scratch their heads and say
        <span class='emp italics quote'>That's not right</span> True, IE/Win does enclose a float within a container
        <span class='emp italics quote'>automatically</span>, however it will if the container element
        happens to possess the MS-only quality called <strong class='emp'>hasLayout</strong>.</p>
      <p>This float-enclosing behavior in IE can also be <span class='empBlue quote'>toggled</span> off again
        just by hovering of links within the container, if that hovering alters either the link background or one of
        several other CSS properties. Quite a mess, which we have seen in the
        <span class='empBlue italics quote'>Guillotine Bug</span> section.</p>
      <p>Cleared elements; as we seen earlier in the things to know section; reference adding additional
        structural markup. without the additional structural markup, - such a cleared box cannot be at
        the same horizontal level as a preceding float. It must appear just below that level. The image shows
        how this might look, with a red border representing the container element: </p>
      <img class='center' src='images/clear-box-floats.gif' />
      <p>The standard method of making an outer container appear to enclose a nested float is to place a
        cleared element last in the container, which has the effect of 'dragging' the lower edge of the
        containing box lower than the float. Thus the float appears to be enclosed within the container
        even though it really isn't. The code for a cleared box usually looks something like this: </p>
      <pre>
        &lt;div&gt; &lt;!-- float container --&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div style="float:left; width:30%;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Text not inside the float&lt;/p&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
        &lt;/div&gt;
      </pre>
      <h2>Issues with this approach</h2>
      <p>The concern or issue with this approach is that this method is not intuitive, requiring an extra
        element to be added to the structural markup. Oce of the major premises of CSS is that it should
        help to reduce the bloated structural markup used in presentation.  The idea of adding markup just
        so floats may be kept within containers, essentially re-bloats the page markup.</p>
      <h2>Clearing for standards based browsers</h2>
      <p>In this approach, <span class='italics'>no clearing element is required.</span> also the approach does not affect IE.</p>
      <h3>Psuedoclass  :after</h3>
      <p>In CSS2 the <span class='emp'>:after</span> psuedoclass allows for extra content to be added at the
        end of a element.  This means no actual markup is needed in the (X)HTML.  the content is specified
        from within the Stylesheet, and it appears in the page as would a (X)HTML element being inserted
        following the target element.  This implies that the <span class='empBlack bold'>:after</span>
        generated conetent cannot receive some CSS properties such as 'table', 'float', 'list', or 'position'
        properties.  However, the 'clear' property is permitted.</p>
      <p>The approach we will use with the <span class='empBlack bold'>:after</span> that will insert a
        simple character such as a 'period' followed by providing the generated element style
        <span class='emp'>{clear:both;}</span>.  Essentially at a minimum, that is all that is required, however
        no one wants a line space meesing the end of their container box that is now fairly clean. so in this
        case we will also <span class='emp'>{height: 0;}</span> and <span class='emp'>{visibility: hidden;}</span>
        to prevent the period from showing. Here is an example:</p>
      <pre>
        .clearfix:after {
          content: ".";
          display: block;
          height: 0;
          clear: both;
          visibility: hidden;
        }
      </pre>
      <p>In observing the above example:  you may have noticed that <span class='emp'>{display: block;}</span>
        is also applied to the <span class='empBlack bold'>:after</span> element, the reason for this:
        if the style is not present and the element is of the inline flavor - then that element defaults to
        <span class='empBlue bold'>inline</span>, and cannot receive the 'clear' property.
        <span class='empBlack bold'>NOTE:</span> if the choice is to use the
        <span class='emp'>{overflow: hidden;}</span> to hide the period - then some browsers may actually
        render the period. </p>
      <h2>What about IE needs?</h2>
      <p>Internet Explore 6 and 7, do not support the <span class='emp'>:after</span> psuedoclass, then we are
        put into a position to be dependent on the same <span class='emp bold italics'>auto-clearing</span>
        effect in IE6, and this behavior happens when the float containing the elements receives a
        <span class='empBlue bold'>hasLayout</span> applied to it.  the solution can be adjusted with a simple
        declaration of <span class='emp quote'>{zoom:1;}</span> will perform this adjustment to IE5.5 and above,
        however it is proprietary to IE and needs to be hidden within IE conditional comments in order to validate.</p>
      <p>As we previously seen in the <span class='emp bold'>Guillotine Bug</span>, Internet Explorer does have some
        special needs with respect to the Auto-enclosing behavior.  <span class='empBlack bold'>Reminder:</span>
        The container element has links inside followed by a float, adding <span class='empBlack bold'>:hover</span>
        psuedoclass may introduce the toggling of hasLayout causing the the lower edge of the container box to
        suddenly jump up and cut-off floated content.  </p>
    </div>
    <div id='guillotineDemo'>
      <div class='guillotine-box'>
        <div class='guillotine-float'>
          <a href='#'>Float Link</a><br />
          Any link in this float will restore the cutoff portion, as will the links in the first two text
          lines outside the float. Something makes those first two lines 'special'.
        </div>
        <a href='#'>Link</a><br />
        <a href='#'>Link</a><br />
        <a href='#'>Link</a><br />
        <a href='#'>Link</a><br />
      </div>
      <div class='guillotine-box'>
        <div class='guillotine-float'>
          <a href='#'>Float Link</a><br />
          The non-floated links to the left are wrapped in a div, and that div has the
          special CSS for IE applied to it. Say <span class='empBlue bold italics'>vaya con dios</span> to the Guillotine Bug!
        </div>
        <div class='clearfix noparachar'>
          <a href='#'>Link</a><br />
          <a href='#'>Link</a><br />
          <a href='#'>Link</a><br />
          <a href='#'>Link</a><br />
        </div>
      </div>
<!--      <div style='clear: both;'></div> -->
    </div>
    <p class='exampleFollow'>The second example has been corrected by placing those links in a div, which then gets the zoom fix applied
      to it. Any block element will work here. Yes, this means another element is needed, however unlike a clearing
      element used previously, this div is a <span class='empBlue bold italics quote'>semantic</span> element.
      Text content really ought to be wrapped in semantic containers to begin with, and since we
      forward-thinking coders always have our content thusly contained, it's easy to apply the same
      <span class='empBlack bold'>.clearfix</span> class to one more element. </p>
    <h2>Making all this work together</h2>
    <p>So far we are looking like we have everything, however - wevery version of IE does have its own way of
      doing things.  In this case IE 5.5 Win/Mac does not auto-clear and it also does not support the
      <span class='empBlack bold'>:after</span> psuedoclass. Our current solion works for almost everything
      except to really make it pretty we need just one more thing. Just apply a
      <span class='emp bold'>{display: inline-block;}</span> (solution found in csscreator)- followed by resetting
      the display in the HTML. So here is the solution.</p>
    <p>First we add the code to the stylesheet itself.  Notice we added a little something for IE/Mac:</p>
    <pre>
      .clearfix:after {
        content: &quot;.&quot;;
        display: block;
        height: 0;
        clear: both;
        visibility: hidden;
      }
      <span class='emp bold'>.clearfix {display: inline-block;}  /* for IE/Mac */</span>
    </pre>
    <p>In the (X)HTML we add our conditional comment to address the IE specific issue.:</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;!--[if lte IE 7]&gt;
      &lt;style type='text/css'&gt;
        /* Only IE can see inside the conditional comment and read this CSS rule. */
        /* Don't ever use a normal HTML comment inside the CC or it will close prematurely. */
        .clearfix {
          zoom: 1;        /* triggers hasLayout */
          <span class='emp bold'>display: block; /* resets display for IE/Win */</span>
        }  
      &lt;/style&gt;
      &lt;![endif]--&gt;
    </pre>
    <div id='footerArea'>This is the footer area, and generally good to have in all pages.
      <a class='footerLink' href='index.php#demo6'>index page</a>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
