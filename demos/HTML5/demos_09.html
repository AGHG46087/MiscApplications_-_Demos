          This quote from Herman Melville's classic novel echoes tales told throughout recent centuries --
          stories in which the great sperm whale is labeled &quot;leviathan,&quot; &quot;monster,&quot;
          and &quot;beast.&quot; For hunters, until as recently as the the late 1980s, slaughtering these
          whales with harpoons was not only good business, but an act of bravery. Whaling is a treacherous
          business: at an average of 62 feet long, the sperm whale (Pyseteridae catadon) is the largest
          of all toothed whales and a fearsome adversary.

          Yet beneath the surface, sperm whales possess more than intimidating girth. As you see in the NATURE
          program SPERM WHALES: THE REAL MOBY DICK, the efforts of Jonathan Gordon and other researchers to study
          the whales' physicality, modes of communication, and social interactions contribute to our understanding
          of the underwater world.

          A giant among marine mammals, a male sperm whale weighs between 40 and 60 tons. Smaller females reach
          a maximum weight of only 18 tons and measure about 35 feet. Both sexes are born with thick gray skin
          that darkens in color with age. As a whale matures, this thick covering may bear the scars caused by
          hunters' weapons, fights over dominance, or wounds picked up while defending young. One of the
          whales Dr. Gordon tracks on NATURE, an enormous adult male named Big Hal, carries on his forehead
          numerous scars of previous battles with rival bulls over females.
          The sheer size of a sperm whale is overwhelming. Its submarine-shaped bulk is capped with a huge,
          blunt-edged head, a full third of its body.

          Two whales

          Whales communicate with each other by clicking. This head is actually a sophisticated communications
          center. Scientists believe that whales' heads contain organs that broadcast and receive the loud
          clicks, called &quot;clangs,&quot that form their language. This clicking noise is sent and received much
          like sonar on a submarine. A whale's head is so large that what sounds to researchers like several
          clicks can actually be just one. As Jonathan Gordon explains, &quot;It's the sound of the clicks
          bouncing around inside its head.&quot;

          Sperm whales &quot;echo-locate&quot; by bouncing a click sound off an object, such as a squid,
          and timing how long it takes for the echo to travel back to them. The whale can then judge the
          distance to its next meal in the darkest of waters. Male adults also use loud clicks to announce
          their presence with authority, while mothers and their young click to stay in communication. Thus
          connected, a cow can leave her offspring alone while she dives for food.
