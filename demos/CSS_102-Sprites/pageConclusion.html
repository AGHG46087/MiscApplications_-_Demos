      <h1>Benefits and pitfalls</h1>
    <p>A couple of final thoughts.
      <ul>
        <li>Browsers: Our new CSS Sprite method tests well in most modern browsers.</li>
        <li>End Users: In the rare cases in which users have turn off images in their browsers but retained CSS,
          a big empty hole will appear in the page where we expect our images to be placed.
          The links are still there and clickable, but nothing visually appears.  </li>
        <li>File size. The natural tendency is to assume that a full double-sized image (Sprites) must be heavier
          than a similar set of sliced images, since the overall image area will usually be larger.
          Plus, one master image requires only a single connection, but each slice would need its own.</li>
        <li>HTML readability: Let's not forget that our markup is nice and clean, with all the advantages
          that go along with that. HTML lists degrade wonderfully. and </li>
        <li>Accessability: A proper image replacement technique will leave the text links accessible to
          screenreaders. Replacing the sprite imagery is dead simple, since all of our dimensions and
          offsets are controlled in a single CSS file, and all of our imagery sits in a single image.</li>
        <li>Performance Payoff: The potential payoff for using this method versus individual images.
          <ul>
            <li>Combined images "may" be smaller in size compared to the size of the sum of the images.</li>
            <li>Less images equates to fewer http connections.</li>
            <li>Smaller images and fewer connections result in fewer packets</li>
            <li>Fewer packets result in fewer bytes wasted on the tcp/ip headers</li>
          </ul>
          <u><b>Thus supporting a faster download capability for the end users.</b></u></li>
        <li>Reuse Images: rather than use a different distinct image for a certain element,
          recycle existing images where appropriate, if the browser has it downloaded and cached,
          it will not retrieve it again. ( buttons example )</li>
        <li>Master Image: The key to benefitting from this method is to ensure that the file size
          of your master image isn't a bloated equivalent versus the sum of its pieces.</li>
      </ul>
