          <h3>Spider-Man</h3>
          <p>One of the world's most popular characters is back on the big screen as a new chapter in the Spider-Man
            legacy is revealed in "The Amazing Spider-Man." Focusing on an untold story that tells a different side
            of the Peter Parker story, the new film stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Campbell
            Scott, Irrfan Khan, with Martin Sheen and Sally Field. The film is directed by Marc Webb from a screenplay
            written by James Vanderbilt, based on the Marvel Comic Book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. Laura Ziskin,
            Avi Arad, and Matt Tolmach are producing the film in association with Marvel Entertainment for Columbia
            Pictures, which will open in theaters everywhere in 3D on July 3, 2012.</p>

          <h3>Ice-Age</h3>
          <p>In "Ice Age: Continental Drift," Scrat's nutty pursuit of the cursed acorn, which he's been after since
            the dawn of time, has world-changing consequences -- a continental cataclysm that triggers the greatest
            adventure of all for Manny, Diego and Sid. In the wake of these earth-shattering upheavals, Sid reunites
            with his long lost family, and the gang encounters a ragtag menagerie of colorful new characters determined
            to stop them from returning home.</p>
