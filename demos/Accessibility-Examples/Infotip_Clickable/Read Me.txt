Here the "aria-live" and "aria-relevant" properties are used to make the popup readable to the screanreader (Jaws).

"assertive" value for "aria-live" property sets the heighest priority for the useragents to notify the user about the change in the respective element, immediately.

"additions" value for "aria-relevant" property is to prioritize the nodes, added to the DOM within the region. So the reader will read only the new message.
