    <h3>Demo:  popup windows</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <p>Pop-up windows provide a unique accessibility problem. First of all, most usability experts would argue against the use of pop-up windows except in the
      most extreme of cases. If you must use pop-up windows, know that they introduce several very unique accessibility issues. For a visual user, it may be
      difficult to notice and navigate to the new window. For someone who is using assistive technologies, the new window may be annoying and confusing because
      the default behavior for the link has been modified. JavaScript implementation may make the new window difficult or impossible to resize or scale for
      someone using a screen enlarger. For someone who is blind, there is typically no indication that they are presently navigating in a new window. When the
      screen reader user attempts to return to the previous page by selecting the back button, it may be confusing to find that this does not work.</p>
      <p><strong>This is considered a non-accessible popup window.</strong>
        <a id="popupLink2" href="./popup_placeholder.html" title="Click here to view a printable page in a new window.">Print this page.</a></p>
      
      <h3>Pop-up example</h3>
      <p>
        <a id="popupLink" target='_blank' href="./popup_placeholder.html" title="New window with printable page.">Select link to view printable page in a new
        window. </a></p>
      <p>
        <a id="popupLink3" href="./TandCs_Print_POC/SDO_TandCs_Print_POC.html" title="Opens T&Cs in new window"><strong>T&amp;C Print Demo</strong></a>
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p><span class="title"><strong>Note</strong></span></p>
        <p>If you are using software to block pop-up windows, you may need disable the software or select the link in a way that bypasses the pop-up blocker<br />
        (typically
          <strong><span class="keycap">Ctrl</span> + click</strong> or
          <strong><span class="keycap">Ctrl</span> +
            <span class="keycap">Enter</span></strong> with the link selected).
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>In the example code above, the link will continue to work normally (i.e., in the same browser window) if JavaScript is disabled.</p>
      <p>When using JavaScript to open new windows, you can modify the size and 
        position of the new window. You can also add or remove functionality of 
        the window, such as the ability to resize, display scroll bars, show tool 
        bars, etc. Be very careful when changing the default behavior of the browser 
        window. If a user has low vision and must enlarge the content, a small 
        window that cannot be enlarged and does not display scroll bars would 
        be very inaccessible. Someone with a motor disability may rely upon large 
        tool bars to accurately control the web browser, so removing or modifying 
        them may introduce difficulties for this user.</p>
      <p>As you can see, there are many difficulties in both usability and accessibility that arise through the use of pop-up windows. Care must be taken in
      making the decision to use them. If they are used, thorough user testing of your implementation is vital to ensure accessibility.
        <em>Always alert the user to the fact that a pop-up window will be opened.</em></p>
