1. Install MAMP into the Applications directory
2. Start up local host should current be pointing to ==> "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs"
3. Select the MAMP control Panel -> Preferences
        Select the "Ports" tab.  and click the "Set to Default Apache and MySQL ports"
        Select the PHP tab, ensure PHP5 is selcted.
        Select the Apache tab, Select the Document Root, ex: "/Users/hansgreiner/Sites"
        Click OK
4. Modify the /etc/hosts file.
        cd to /etc
        sudo vi hosts (enter root password)
        Add in the hosts to the localhost IP:
        ex: 127.0.0.1 mysite
            127.0.0.1 demos
5. Create a restart script of Apache if desired.
       cd /Users/hansgreiner/bin
       create the script name and add the contents (and comments if desired):
           /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/apachect1 stop
           sleep 5
           /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/apachect1 start
       Save the file
6. Configure the httpd.conf file
       if a Soft link is desired for the httpd.conf
         cd to the Document root set from step 3  "/Users/hansgreiner/Sites"
         ln -s /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf hans.httpd
       Edit the httpd.conf either from soft link or actual location.
       Ensure the php5_module is uncommented.
           LoadModule php5_module        modules/libphp5.so
       Set the approprite DirectoryIndoex priority of file types.
           DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
       Set the Virtual hosts identified from Step 4 in editing the /etc/hosts
           NameVirtualHost *
           <VirtualHost *>
             DocumentRoot "/Users/hansgreiner/Sites/"
             ServerName localhost
           </VirtualHost>

           <VirtualHost *>
             DocumentRoot "/Users/hansgreiner/Sites/demos/"
             ServerName demos
           </VirtualHost>

           <VirtualHost *>
             DocumentRoot "/Users/hansgreiner/Sites/mysite/"
             ServerName mysite
           </VirtualHost>
7.  If behind a proxy make sure the virtual host domains are in the proxy exclusion list in the
    browser as they are local.
8.  If running VMWare and would like to access the MAMP server
       Stop the VMWare Fusion if Running
       Go the WMWare Preferences under Network Adapters ( VMWare can run upto 3 adapters )
       If needed Add a new Adapter that is "Host Only".
            This has a network adapter that ties to the MAC internaly. this will bind to "vmnet1" switch
            info: There are also nine virtual Ethernet switches, designated as VMnet0 - VMnet8
                  VMnet0 is dedicated to bridged mode,
                  VMnet1 is dedicated to Host Only mode, and
                  VMnet8 is for NAT (Network Address Translation) mode.
                  VMnet2 - VMnet7, are available to be used by the VM when using Custom networking mode.
       Restart the VMWare Fusion Windows app.
       In a mac terminal window type command ifconfig vmnet1.  capture the inet address: ex: 172.16.41.1
       Get the goofy name of the computer local hostname that MAC sets up.  can be captured from System Preferences
         Open System Preferences
         Click on Sharing
         Click the Edit button, see the name. EX: hans-greiners-macbook-pro-2.local
       In the Windows (inside VMWare) we are going to modify the hosts file
         open file C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
         add the inet address captured from the ifconfig vmnet1 and the goofy name, along with virtual hosts
         EX: 172.16.41.1  hans-greiners-macbook-pro-2.local localhost.local mysite demos
         open a cmd window and type ipconfig /flushdns
9.  Lastly if behind a proxy sure the virtual host domains are in the proxy exclusion list in the
    browser as they are local.
